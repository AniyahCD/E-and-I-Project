Project Report

What is your project about?

My project was about exploring the streets of japan in vr. The player goes through a small story of helping a lost kid find his mom and going to the convince store. 

What was the additional skill?

The additional skill was adding in coded elements like objectives, markers and a dialogue manager. Also adding in voice acting for the characters. 

What was a key challenge you overcame or an element of the project you want to highlight?

I want to highlight the dialogue system I was most excited to work on that part of the project. I worked in garage band and made some sounds myself like the stomach rumbling sound. I also think it’s cool I could get 3 Japanese classmates to do voice lines for me. It was difficult getting the voice lines converting them and figuring out garage band, mixing audio, and using it in unity.
